Notes:
1. Interface basically contains abstract methods/functions.
2. Variables are static and final by default in the interface.
3. Interface mostly specifies what class is doing not how it doing it.

Q. Why variables in the interface are final in nature?
Variables in the interface are static and final by default because we don't have a constructor in the interface so in order to initialized it we need a
constructor but for final variables we need to initialize it when we declaring.

Implementations:
Abstract class can provide implementations of the interface but interface can't provide implementations for the abstract class.

We can implement multiple interfaces together.

About the accessibility:
Members of the interface are public by default.

Class can implements number of the interfaces, but only extend a single abstract class or super class.

Two classes un related to each other can also implement same interfaces.

Important:
We need to create a separate class for each interface;
