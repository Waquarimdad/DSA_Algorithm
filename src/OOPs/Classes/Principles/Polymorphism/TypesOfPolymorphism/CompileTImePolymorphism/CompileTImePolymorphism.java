        Compile time polymorphism or static polymorphism.
        Achieved via method overloading or it can also been achieved via operator overloading but in java we don't have operator overloading concept.

        Method overloading: We have more than one methods having same name but having:
                            1. different parameters
                            2. different parameter data types
                            3. return type.
                            4. different ordering types // Example: void sum(int a, String b) {} and int sum(String a, int b) { return a + b; }
        Example: Multiple constructors.
