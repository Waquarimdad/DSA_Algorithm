     /*
        Multiple inheritance: One class extending more than 1 class.
        Example: (Parent class A) and (Parent class B), (Child class) will extend (both this parent class A and B).
        Multiple inheritance is not supported by java.
        Let's assume we have  (variable n) in both of this parent class A and B. If child class extends both of this parent class A and B,
        then  if we want to print the value of variable n then what it prints. It will cause ambiguous error.
        Because java will not differentiate which variable n need to be printed.

        (Important: As multiple inheritance is not supported by java. We can achieve the same using interfaces in Java.)
        Multiple inheritance is achieved in java by using interfaces.
