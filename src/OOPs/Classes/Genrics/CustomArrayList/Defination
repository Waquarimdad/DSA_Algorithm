Internal working of ArrayList:

1. Initially the size of the arrayList is 10 or we say that it as a DEFAULT_SIZE.
2. Whenever the size of the arrayList is full, it double the size of the array internally.
3. After doubling the size of the arrayList, it will internally copy the previous data into the ArrayList and insert the new data into the
arrayList.

The Custom array list that we have created just takes integer data type but arrayList will takes all other data type as well. So we need to
fix this.
We can fix this by using generic arrayList.

ArrayList<Integer> list = new ArrayList<Integer>; Heer Integer functionality is provided by the generic.
If we pass any thing other than what we declared it's throws an exception.
Generic helps in providing type to the data structure.
Generic also provides type safety.
We cannot create instance of type parameter.
