Parent class is only going to give the generalized from of the method not the method body. It's only give the name of the method.

Syntax:

abstract void career(String name);
Child class must override the parent method in order to use it.
Any class that contains one or more than one abstract method must also be declared as abstract class.

use case:
if we definitely know methods in the parent class needs to be overridden then make those abstract methods.

Important Notes:
1. We can't create an object of an abstract class but in order to create an object we need to implement the abstract method. If we create an object of
the abstract class then if we call the abstract method then it throws an exception that it doesn't have method body.
2. Abstract construct is not allowed.
3. Static method can't be override.
4. we can create normal methods in abstract class just like abstract methods and we also override in the sub classes.

We are able to create normal constructor but we are not able to create abstract constructor.
We are also not able to create (abstract static  method) as well.

Note: Hence we are not able to create abstract object but we can use it as a reference variable.
