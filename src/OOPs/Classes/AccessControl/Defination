1. Public:
2. Private : We are not able to access the members outside the class even in same package.
3. Protected : Protected is used when we talking about inheritance.
4. Default : We are not able to access outside the package but we are able access outside the class.

Note: Subclass meaning (inheritance).

class Parent {

}
clas Child extends Parent{
    // This is called subclass.
}

Q. When to use which access modifier.

Private: It is used when we want to hide sensitive information... Example:  Encapsulation
No modifier is also called Default modifier: Don't want to be used outside the particular package.

Important Point Related to Protected Modifier:

-> Only the subclass can access the protected members in the base class/parent class when it is in different package.
   Even parent class not able toa access the protected members of it's own class from different package.
