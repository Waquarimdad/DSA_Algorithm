Vector is just like ArrayList.

Important point to note:
Vector is synchronized. What it means is that Only one thread can access it at a time.
In ArrayList multiple threads can access the same object. ArrayList is not synchronized. It is asynchronized.

Vector is slower than arrayList because it is waiting for the thread to complete it execution before assigning it to some other thread that is
waiting for it turn. In other hand Array list is accessed by multiple threads at the same time so it is faster than Vector.
