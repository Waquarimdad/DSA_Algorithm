Enums are group of variables.

Some important points:

These are enum constants.
1. Every single enum here is public, static and final.
2. Since it is final we can't create child enum. Because if we declare class as a enum we can't inherit.
3. Here type is Week.

Enum can implement as much interface as it can.
